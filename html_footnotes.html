<!-- This is a comment to note that any HTML doc needs to start with a boilerplate
to ensure that everything is structured properly.
    VSCode provides a shortcut where on a blank .html file, you can type ! and hit enter to auto create the boilerplate
    That was done here but will only be done once the boilerplate is memorized

                is enclosed in an opening tag and a closing tag.
